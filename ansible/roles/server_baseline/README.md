server_baseline
=========

This role makes a baseline configuration for linux servers. The following configurations are made:

- Create a user with sudo privileges*
- Copy your SSH key to the server and disable password-based authentication
- Update apt/dnf and ensure a list of default packages are present
- Install any additional desired system packages
- Configure default deny on the firewall, allowing SSH connections* 
- Install and bring up [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). For more info, see the tailscale [README](../../tailscale-info/README.md).

*Not executed on Proxmox hosts

Requirements
------------

#### Supported operating systems
- As of the latest update, the only tested and supported operating systems are **Ubuntu 22.04**, **Fedora 40** and **Proxmox 8**. Other versions may work but have not been tested.

#### Tailscale Oauth client secret
- You will need a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) account and an [Oauth client](https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/oauth-clients) secret. See the tailscale [README](../../tailscale-info/README.md) for more info.

Role Variables
--------------
#### Required Variables
Not providing these variables will cause the task to fail.
```YAML
server_baseline_server_baseline_created_username: <your-username> # Enter the user you wish to create with sudo privileges.
server_baseline_tailscale_oauth_client_secret: <your-tailscale-oauth-client-secret> # Your Tailscale Oauth client. It is recommended to store this in dictionary format like the example provided.
server_baseline_timezone: <server-timezone> # Timezone to set on the server 
```

#### Examples - Required Variables

```YAML
# Task will fail if these are not provided
server_baseline_server_baseline_created_username: josh
server_baseline_tailscale_oauth_client_secret: "{{ tailscale_servers_oauth_client['secret] }}" # From Ansible vault - must be stored as dict value!
server_baseline_timezone: America/New_York
```

#### Optional Variables

Use the below variables to install additional packages (beyond the below listed defaults) on the desired hosts.

```YAML
server_baseline_fedora_packages: # Any additional packages you would like installed beyond defaults. 
server_baseline_ubuntu_packages: # Any additional packages you would like installed beyond defaults.
server_baseline_proxmox_packages: # Any additional packages you would like installed beyond defaults.
```

#### Examples - Optional Variables
```YAML
server_baseline_fedora_packages: 
  - borgbackup
  - tmux
server_baseline_ubuntu_packages:
  - aptitude
  - borgbackup
  - tmux
server_baseline_proxmox_packages:
  - tmux
  - iperf3
```

Dependencies
------------

#### artis3n.tailscale
- This role relies on the [artis3n.tailscale](https://github.com/artis3n/ansible-role-tailscale) role. Because this role is a member of a collection, and artis3n.tailscale is a standalone role, it **will not be installed automatically as a dependency.** 
- Run the following command to install:

```bash
ansible-galaxy role install artis3n.tailscale
```

Example Playbook
----------------

 The following is an example playbook for Ubuntu servers:

```YAML
---
- name: Initial setup for servers
  hosts: all

  tasks:
    - name: Include variables from Ansible vault file
      include_vars: secrets.yml

    - name: Server baseline
      include_role:
        name: joshrnoll.homelab.server_baseline
      vars:
        server_baseline_created_username: josh
        server_baseline_tailscale_oauth_client_secret: "{{ tailscale_servers_oauth_key['key'] }}" # From Ansible Vault file
        server_baseline_ubuntu_packages:
          - borgbackup
          - aptitude
          - tmux
        server_baseline_fedora_packages:
          - borgbackup
          - tmux
        server_baseline_proxmox_packages:
          - aptitude
          - tmux
...
```
#### IMPORTANT!

It's recommended to store your secrets in Ansible Vault. To create a vault file called ```secrets.yml``` use the following command:

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

Put any sensitive variables in this file. An example of an Ansible Vault file:
```YAML
# Your Tailscale Oauth client secret in dict format
tailscale_servers_oauth_key:
  key: <your-oauth-client-secret>
```

#### Calling the Playbook

Ensure you use ```--ask-become-pass``` and ```--ask-vault-pass``` when calling your playbook. Example:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.yml --ask-become-pass --ask-vault-pass
```

You can also use the aliases ```-K``` for ```--ask-become-pass``` and ```-J``` for ```--ask-vault-pass```. Example:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.yml -K -J
```

Further notes
-------------

The original work of this role is based on the server_baseline module from the community.general collection. I have added a lot of custom functionality and configuration options to make it fit my use case and to help me learn Ansilble. If you want the real deal, check out the original module here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/server_baseline.html
The code here might have diverged significantly from the original module, but I am grateful for the work that was done by the maintainers of the community.general collection to create the server_baseline module which made this role possible.
